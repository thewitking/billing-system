Project description: 
The project that we want to implement is Real time object detection based billing system. We want to build a solution around object detection and evaluating its price, and analysis of sell for inventory management.


Idea: idea is to use a deep neural network approach for various object detection so to evaluate price of all the items. And to use regression analysis for predicting the inventory suggestions.



Future- Extension: This project can be extended with a sophisticated network of high resolution cameras to evaluate the price of objects as soon the customer picks or drops a product item from certain area. Which makes the whole shopping experience for the customer smooth. While in parallel the same system can recognize the different customers and help them with their shopping experience.
